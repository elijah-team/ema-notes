## Top Ten Architectural Problems in all of Eclipse

Introduction and Purpose of this Document

Ok, maybe more, maybe less than 10, but the purpose of this page is for AC members to begin to articulate what we as a group think the architectural problems are in Eclipse. At first, this page will have a form of "online brainstorming" ... anything can be listed ... but over the next few weeks, we'll polish, refine, categorize and abstract issue to the "root" problem. Then, during the January meeting, we'll discuss them more and priorities them and hopefully get commitments from within our group to work on them.
