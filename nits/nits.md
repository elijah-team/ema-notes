1. Renovate is noisy

  - (i would like) Commit to a branch and merge, blah blah

  - This may be a configuration issue

  - If not, then it's not a lot of work to script it

2. Capture output in artifacts for later processing (ie by `plz, cef`)

  - QueryDB ...

  - Permazen (maybe, prolly not)

3. in re: cef, avoid javascript at all costs

  - there are options...

4. "feature" flow vs. linear

  - irritating, write jj/graphite plugin

  - app.trunk.io shows spinner
  
5. editors/ides

  - vscode is nice, fleet is ok.  (no/less dialog boxes.)

  - jetbrains paid might be an option

  - is it zed, xi or zi?

  - netbeans?

6. alt tab in gnome is torture

7. why ARE we still installing apps (or at least oses??), john?

8. woodpecker, charm confusing me

  - no way im that stupid

9. [SOLVED] nix gnome can't install extensions

  - the user is required to enable them in extensions extension

10. nix gnome doesn't do that drag to edge thing

  - comes with a base config?

  - "ubuntu is nice" (as in preconfigured in a lot of cases)

11. [WONTFIX] mynixos should basically be shipped with nix

   - idk if they are offering a paid tier as a business thingy

   - update, they are.

12. nix-software-center should not ask for a root pw

  - overcomplicate it with pushing to git

  - maybe something like: https://github.com/nlewo/comin

13. either gnome-software or snap store on ubuntu makes you wait (for icons)

  - uninstalled them both

14. ubuntu installer:

  - installs 16gb of fonts on uncompressed ext4 and nobody sees this as a problem
    
  - let me use btr from the installer

  - let me use zfs from the installer

15. it comes with calamares!

16. my config langugage has if statements

17. flutter looks nice, but i can't use the keyboard (subiquity)

18. fedora installer enum's all btr subvolumes

  - not fun with apt-btr-snapshot

19. dear eazel, my desktop is not a tablet

  - that being said, i'll wait for the phone. i think it's gonna be great.

20. samsung, fix one ui

  - i know it's not _completely_ your fault

  - [UPDATE] the launcher is nice, though a little too involved

21. samsung, gimme black emojis

  - you guys make great products

  - i just would like to feel great using them

  - some american policies are made more for americans

22. it would be nice to see more qubes

23. why doesnt apt have --root like void and nix?

  - xbps-install is refreshing

  - (and i like their installer)

24. fix the control panel on deepin

  - why did they change it?

25. kde1 had almost direct counterparts to coreutils

  - i think the only way to make it better (in the past tense of course) would be to
    have a command line/text box on the bottom of the window so ppl could learn what
    they are (supposed to be) doing

  - and also to make it look like gnome

26. maybe reiser5 will be good (like 3)

  - nixos bcache doesn't boot for some reason

27. lvm for all!

  - the lesson of zfs is that raw partitions are stupid

  - the other lesson of zfs is that management/admin ux/flow matters

  - the lesson of efi is that there is a way to force fat32 on everybody

  - is it xfat?

  - or exfat?

28. remove os-prober.  doesn't even make sense.

29. there's like 35 clipboards

  - this is historical, not (exactly) a complaint

30. dialog boxes are stupid

31. i don't care about cookies

32. im lying, i like cookies as much as the next person

33. in maven: pin dependency resolution for "jar-sets" to a server/host/whatever (everybody calls it something different (maybe))

34. learn the dougie and break through barriers

35. explain how git is or is not a filesystem

36. bash is a great scripting language

  - change your login shell

  - i really like the ideas that warp.dev demoed

37. zig is nice. i (think i) feel for /u/lattner.

38. eclipse/idea maven seem to like forgetting random parts of the config

  - this may or not be my fault.

39. many of the jvm languages duplicate things.

40. all of the java ides duplicate things.

  - (work is progressing...)

41. theres a couple different ways to express things in scala.

  - and a lot of other ones, too -- reflecting on how much is necessary
    to accomplish out goals.

42. youtube is my netflix (aka $9 a month)

43. youtube app is like elevated, a little bit of everything for everybody

    - kind of unfocused
   
    - hope they figure it out.

44. they are persistent with conversion attempts, even when you ask them not to be

45. their recommendations can be inaccurate (also spotify)

  - search is always global, and does not reflect actual listening patterns

  - search is generally useless now and they don't wat to fix it (sad face)

46. ports and 9fs vs electron

  - see fuschia

  - see fuchsia

47. I tried the gitlab deb.  With 2 repos, at rest, it takes 12GB RAM??
