## Still will not stop complaining

1. Stop cutting your hair with beard trimmers

2. Capture output in artifacts for later processing (ie by `plz, cef`)

  - QueryDB ...

  - Permazen (maybe, prolly not)

3. in re: cef, avoid javascript at all costs

  - there are options...

4. "feature" flow vs. linear

  - irritating, do your own thing.

  - that doesn't solve the problem, but it solves your problem

5. editors/ides

  - vscode is nice, fleet is ok.  (no/less dialog boxes.)

  - jetbrains paid might be an option

  - is it zed, xi or zi?

  - netbeans?

6. alt tab in gnome is torture

7. why ARE we still installing apps (or at least oses??), john?

  - portable services.

  - immutable distros.

  - qubes really needs more docs.

  - i would have nixos years ago iuf they would have explained nix-env correctly.

8. woodpecker, charm confusing me

  - no way im that stupid

9. [SOLVED] nix gnome can't install extensions

  - the user is required to enable them in extensions extension

10. nix gnome doesn't do that drag to edge thing

  - comes with a base config?

  - "ubuntu is nice" (as in preconfigured in a lot of cases)

11. [WONTFIX] mynixos should basically be shipped with nix

   - idk if they are offering a paid tier as a business thingy

   - update, they are.

12. nix-software-center should not ask for a root pw

  - overcomplicate it with pushing to git

  - maybe something like: https://github.com/nlewo/comin

13. either gnome-software or snap store on ubuntu makes you wait (for icons)

  - uninstalled them both

14. ubuntu installer:

  - installs 16gb of fonts on uncompressed ext4 and nobody sees this as a problem
    
  - let me use btr from the installer

  - let me use zfs from the installer

15. it comes with calamares!

16. my config langugage has if statements

17. flutter looks nice, but i can't use the keyboard (subiquity)

18. fedora installer enum's all btr subvolumes

  - not fun with apt-btr-snapshot

19. dear eazel, my desktop is not a tablet

  - that being said, i'll wait for the phone. i think it's gonna be great.

20. emojis. f-u, this is america :flag:

21. samsung, gimme black emojis

  - you guys make great products

  - i just would like to feel great using them

  - some american policies are made more for americans

22. it would be nice to see more qubes

23. why doesnt apt have --root like void and nix?

  - xbps-install is refreshing

  - (and i like their installer)

  - guix install is refreshing

24. fix the control panel on deepin

  - why did they change it?

  - stop complaining, you didn't like it that much -- infinite scrolling is an antipattern. (cough firefox)

25. kde1 had almost direct counterparts to coreutils

  - i think the only way to make it better (in the past tense of course) would be to
    have a command line/text box on the bottom of the window so ppl could learn what
    they are (supposed to be) doing.

  - and also to make it look like gnome. [french guys]

26. maybe reiser5 will be good (like 3)

  - nixos bcache doesn't boot for some reason.

  - wear baggy pants and/or lose out to some asshole in a turtleneck.

27. lvm for all!

  - the lesson of zfs is that raw partitions are stupid

  - the other lesson of zfs is that management/admin ux/flow matters

  - the lesson of efi is that there is a way to force fat32 on everybody

  - is it xfat?

  - or exfat?

  - vdo, thin provisioning, ... --> here soon

  - zfs can be simulated with btrfs/bcachefs and some scripts for my u.c. (maybe, mostly)

28. "fix" os-prober

  - the constant probing doesn't make work in the real world.

  - /u/0pointer is kinda right with either bootspec or one of those 1000 gpt uuids.

  - reming yourself to find a pretty theme for refind...

  - and make it read grub configs. (duh)

29. [SEMI-SOLVED] there's like 35 clipboards

  - this is historical, not (exactly) a complaint

30. dialog boxes are stupid

  - [remove complaint] "Just" configure the wm

31. i don't care about cookies

32. im lying, i like cookies a little bit too much

33. in maven: pin dependency resolution for "jar-sets" to a server/host/whatever (everybody calls it something different (maybe))

34. learn the dougie and break through barriers

35. [SOLVED] explain how git is or is not a filesystem

  - semi-distributed object store.

  - primarily presented as a list of files.

36. bash is a great scripting language

  - change your login shell(, plz).

  - i really like the ideas that warp.dev demoed ;).

  - i do not like the terminal in idea 2024.

37. zig is nice. i (think i) feel for /u/lattner.

  - still llvm, tho.

38. [SEMI-SOLVED] eclipse/idea maven seem to like forgetting random parts of the config

  - this is partially my fault, yes

  - but i am working with very simple projects

  - also, nobody cares/we are all volunteers/go make a crypto coin/calm down.

39. many of the jvm languages duplicate things.

40. all of the java ides duplicate things.

  - (work is progressing...)

  - gmaven, maven-model.jar, im sure others

41. "theres a couple different ways to express things in scala."

  - and a lot of other ones, too -- reflecting on how much is necessary
    to accomplish out goals.

42. [SEMI-SOLVED] youtube is my netflix (aka $9 a month)

43. youtube app is like elevated, a little bit of everything for everybody

    - kind of unfocused

    - hope they figure it out.

44. they are persistent with conversion attempts, even when you ask them not to be

  - poTest?

  - rust and other elements?

45. their recommendations can be inaccurate (also spotify)

  - search is always global, and does not reflect actual listening patterns

  - search is generally useless now and they don't wat to fix it (sad face)

46. ports and 9fs vs electron

  - see fuschia.

  - see fuchsia (should have stolen the alligator, or whatever it was called -- the demo).

  - see inferno.

47. I tried the gitlab deb.  With 2 repos, at rest, it takes 12GB RAM??

  - How light weight is k8s/minikube/k3s?

  - Aka solving one problem (Gitea/Forgejo - cant type that) with another...

  - Sounds like a problem for next year.

48. Have you tried plaint?

  - tastes almost as good as pie.

49. intentionally left blank

  - aka please disreagrd the parts that are obviously incorrect.

50. i
