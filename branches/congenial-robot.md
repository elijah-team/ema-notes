"Nobody likes me."

1. kotlin coroutines instead of mutiny, apparently

2. single maven submodule

  - honestly, kinda stupid

3. small main branch

  - `ep/rolling` prefers linear

4. probably created to test `Rosetta`

  - EzSpec is wrong (should not have InputSteam)

  - This may or may not be fixed somewhere.
